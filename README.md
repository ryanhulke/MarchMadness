# March Madness ML

### Project Description
- March Madness [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024)
- Utilizing data from both <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024/data> and <https://kenpom.com/>

## Getting Started
- `git clone https://github.com/ryanhulke/MarchMadness.git`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- the data is already prepped and ready in data_2025/clean/new_data.csv if you wanna just jump straight to `src/model_testing.ipynb` and start trying different models.
- otherwise if you wanna try your own feature engineering, go to `src/data_preprocessing.ipynb`. If you do, keep in mind you need a subscription access Kenpom stats via `add_kenpom_stats.ipynb`.
