    "    - home/away/neutral\n",

    "    - decide how to calculate pace, momentum, and experience\n",
    "    - figure out where to get experience, size, and conference data\n",
    "2. create data.csv with each feature for each of 2 teams, home & away, with label W or L for that tourney game\n",
    "    - if that's not enough data, then we can train on reg season games too with an additional variable of num_games_played\n",

    "4. test many models\n",
